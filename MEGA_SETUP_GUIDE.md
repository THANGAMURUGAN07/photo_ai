## 🐛 Troubleshooting MEGA

### Problem: "Login failed"

**Solution:**
1. Verify email and password are correct
2. Try logging in at https://mega.nz to confirm

4. Make sure no extra spaces in `.env`

**Example of correct `.env`:**

MEGA_EMAIL=myemail@example.com
MEGA_PASSWORD=MyPassword123
```

MEGA_EMAIL= myemail@example.com    ← Extra space!
MEGA_PASSWORD=MyPassword123 
```

### Problem: "Bandwidth limit exceeded"

**What it means:**
- Free MEGA accounts have bandwidth limits

**Solutions:**
1. **Wait:** Limit resets after a few hours

3. **Use VPN:** Sometimes helps reset limits
4. **Spread uploads:** Upload in smaller batches

### Problem: "Storage quota exceeded"

**What it means:**
- You've used all 50GB free storage

**Solutions:**
1. **Delete old events:** Free up space
2. **Upgrade to Pro:** Get more storage
3. **Switch to AWS S3:** Pay-as-you-go pricing

### Problem: Tests fail with "Connection timeout"
