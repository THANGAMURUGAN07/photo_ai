# ‚úÖ Using deepface_match_fixed.py - FIXED!

## What Was Fixed

Your `deepface_match_fixed.py` script had **two critical issues** that prevented it from working:

### 1. **Wrong Function Being Called**
**Problem:** The main() function was calling `test_find_and_visualize()` which is a demo function, not the actual processing logic.

**Fixed:** Now calls `processor.run()` which does the actual face matching.

### 2. **No WebP Support**
**Problem:** Your selfies are in `.webp` format, but the script only looked for `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`.

**Fixed:** Added `.webp` support throughout the script.

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### `deepface_match_fixed.py`:
1. **Lines 466-474:** Changed from calling `test_find_and_visualize()` to `processor.run()`
2. **Line 189:** Added `.webp` to selfie file detection
3. **Line 194:** Added `.webp` to photo file detection  
4. **Line 225:** Added `.webp` to photo processing
5. **Line 245:** Added `.webp` to selfie validation

### `app.js`:
- You already switched back to using `deepface_match_fixed.py` ‚úÖ

## üöÄ How to Use

### Just restart your server and process:

```bash
# Your server should already be running
# Just go to http://localhost:5000
# Click "Process Event" for wedding_1
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The script uses these defaults:
- **Threshold:** 0.6 (balanced - same as before)
- **Model:** VGG-Face (accurate)
- **Detector:** MTCNN (accurate but slower)
- **Distance Metric:** Cosine

## üìä Expected Behavior

### During Processing:

  üì∏ Total selfies: 2

  üéØ Photos matched: 15

```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Processing Time

This script uses `DeepFace.verify()` which is **slower but very accurate**:

| Photos | Guests | Expected Time |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| 50     | 1-2    | 2-5 min |
| 100    | 1-2    | 5-10 min |
| 500    | 5-10   | 25-40 min |
| 1000   | 10-20  | 60-90 min |

**Note:** This is the original algorithm. If you want faster processing (10-15x), use `fast_face_match.py` instead.

## üéØ Adjusting Threshold

If you're getting too many or too few matches, adjust the threshold:

### From Web Interface:
The default is 0.6 (60% similarity required)

### Manual Testing:
```bash
# Stricter (fewer matches, higher accuracy)
.venv\Scripts\python.exe deepface_match_fixed.py events\wedding_1 0.3

# Balanced (default)
.venv\Scripts\python.exe deepface_match_fixed.py events\wedding_1 0.6

# Relaxed (more matches)
.venv\Scripts\python.exe deepface_match_fixed.py events\wedding_1 0.7
```

## üîÑ Switching Between Scripts

### To use the OLD script (current - slower but accurate):
```javascript
// In app.js line 452:
const pythonScript = path.join(__dirname, 'deepface_match_fixed.py');
```

### To use the FAST script (10-15x faster):
```javascript
// In app.js line 452:
const pythonScript = path.join(__dirname, 'fast_face_match.py');
```

## üìù Summary

‚úÖ **Fixed:** Script now calls the correct processing function
‚úÖ **Fixed:** Added webp support for modern image formats
‚úÖ **Ready:** Your script will now actually process photos
‚úÖ **Accurate:** Uses MTCNN detector and VGG-Face model for high accuracy

**The script is now ready to use!** Just process your event and it should find matches. üéâ

## üí° Pro Tip

If processing is too slow, consider switching to `fast_face_match.py`:
- **10-15x faster** processing
- **Same accuracy** (uses VGG-Face)
- **Real-time progress** updates
- Just change line 452 in app.js
